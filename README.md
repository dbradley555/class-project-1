# Culture Cruncher

## Description

This application is designed to inform users about cultures and cuisines of different countries. This will help users that are interested in traveling to a specfic destination (or need help picking a destination), increase their knowledge of some key facts about the culture of a country, such as popular food, language, currency, etc. The application uses the REST Countries and YouTube APIs to display information and a video about a user inputted (or random) country.

## Usage

The user will input the name of the desired country in the search bar and click the "search" button. The user also has the option to click the "random country" button, which will display facts and a video about a random country. Also, as the user inputs countries, they will display in the "search history" column on the left side. The user can click on one of these countries to display the video and facts about a previously searched country. When the user reloads or revisits the page, their previously searched countries will still display. To clear the previously searched countries, the user can click on the "clear history" button.
